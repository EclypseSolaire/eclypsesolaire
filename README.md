### About me âœ¨
I'm **EclypseSolaire** *or* **eclyline** (but you can call me "Damian" - it's my name).  
**15 (soon to be 16) years old**, high school student. ðŸ”­
I enjoy **coding** from time to time (I don't really have time at the moment tho).  
I like **computers** and IT in general (studying **numerics and informatic science** & **engineering science** in high school).

I already coded in **Java, Python, and HTML/CSS (only a bit of these two)**.

I use the marriage of **macOS and coding**. ðŸ‘¯
